FeenBan is a WordPress plugin for shadowbanning / hellbanning commenters.

== Description ==

FeenBan is a simple WordPress plugin that implements user [shadowbanning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbanning) (or hellbanning) for comments.

Comments by shadowbanned users will be invisible to all other users. However, the shadowbanned users will continue to see their own comments, hopefully oblivious to the fact that they've been shadowbanned. This is non-destructive in that changes are not made to the comments themselves. Shadowbanned comments are still saved to the database and visible to admins in the dashboard comments listing. All that happens is that a 'shadowban' flag is set in the user metadata. (Please note that this metadata will in no way cause the user to be droned.)

If you disable this plugin, showbanned comments will become visible to all users.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the name FeenBan? =

This plugin is called FeenBan because it was a special request from Michael W. Dean of the Freedom Feens Talk Radio Show. Find out more about Freedom Feens at http://freedomfeens.com.

= Can you make it so non-logged in users can see all comments? =

Not really because it all hinges on knowing who's looking at the page. If the site doesn't know the visitor's identity, it's not going to know if they're shadowbanned. Aside from logging in, there are two common ways to identify the user:

* Cookies
* IP address

Both of these are so easy to work around. The shadowbanned user can discover their status if they happen to switch from laptop to phone between browsing sessions. They'll then just make up a new alias and you're back to square one.
